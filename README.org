**  Doom Emacs ~.doom.d~

[[file:images/doom-emacs.png]]

*** Install

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
make quickstart
#+END_SRC

*** Emacs daemon

I highly recommend using ~systemd~ for managing Emacs daemon. You can find my
service unit file at
[[https://github.com/PoiScript/dotfiles/blob/master/systemd/emacs.service][here]].

*Note*:

+ Sometimes, your GUI-specify configuration (e.g. changing font family for
  specific fontset or toggling transparent background) may not be applied when
  using ~emacsclient -c~. Because Emacs is started up by the ~systemd~ and there
  doesn't exist any graphical display so your configuration is ignored. A
  [[https://github.com/PoiScript/dotfiles/blob/master/.doom.d/init.el#L13-L19][workaround]]
  is to hook up ~after-make-frame-functions~ and check if the frame is on a
  graphical display.

*** rls (rust language server)

At the time of writing (2018-9-6), Doom Emacs
[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/pull/716][doesn't support lsp (language
server protocol)]]. But it's quite easy to
[[https://github.com/PoiScript/dotfiles/blob/master/.doom.d/config.el#L39-L61][make
it happens.]]

*Note*:

+ Make sure you have installed rls: ~rustup component add rls-preview
  rust-analysis rust-src~ first.

+ If you can't get the completion for the extern crate, you can run ~cargo
  metadata~ and then try again.

** Tmux ~.tmux.conf~

[[file:images/tmux.png]]

Install ~xclip~ for accessing system clipboard.

*** Key binding

*Create pane*: ~C-t \~, ~C-t -~

*Navigate pane*: ~C-t h~, ~C-t j~, ~C-t k~, ~C-t l~

*Navigate window*: ~M-k~, ~M-j~
